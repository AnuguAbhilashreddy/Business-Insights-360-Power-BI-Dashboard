# Business Insights 360: Power BI Dashboard
# Project Overview
This project, "Business Insights 360," is a comprehensive Power BI solution developed as part of the @Codebasics Bootcamp  for AtliQ Hardwares, a growing consumer electronics company. The primary goal was to transition AtliQ Technologies from traditional Excel-based analysis to a dynamic, interactive Power BI dashboard, enabling deeper and more actionable insights across various business functions.
# Problem Statement
AtliQ Technologies relied heavily on Excel for their data analysis, which limited their ability to perform in-depth analysis, identify trends, and gain real-time insights across their diverse product portfolio (PCs, keyboards, etc.). There was a clear need for a more robust and scalable business intelligence solution.
# Objective
The core objective was to address critical business queries and deliver targeted, data-driven insights to key stakeholders across multiple departments: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive leadership, all within a Power BI environment.
# Tools & Technologies Used
** SQL (MySQL): Utilized for efficient data extraction and initial transformation from the company's database.
** Power Query (within Power BI): Employed extensively for advanced Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes, including data cleaning, shaping, merging, appending, and    creating new tables to ensure data quality and analytical readiness.
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for developing complex calculations, measures, and calculated columns to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) and advanced insights.
** Data Modeling: Crucial for establishing and managing robust relationships between various dimension and fact tables, creating a cohesive and optimized data model for analysis.
**Power BI Desktop: The primary development environment for creating interactive reports, dashboards, and visualizations.

# The project delivered tailored insights through dedicated views for different business functions:
** Finance view :
  Key KPIs: Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Net Profit %.
   P&L statement analysis and performance tracking.
   Insights on top and bottom-performing products and customers.
** Sales View:
Customer and product performance analysis based on Net Sales and Gross Margin.
** Marketing View:
  Regional and market-wise analysis of Net Sales, Gross Margin, and Net Profit.
  Strategic insights into product performance for margin improvement.
** Supply Chain View:
  Net error and forecast accuracy tracking to identify demand gaps.
  Solutions to reduce risks like out-of-stock situations or overstocking.
** Executive View:
  High-level KPIs for leadership: Revenue, Gross Margin %, Net Profit %, Market Share %, and Forecast Accuracy.
	PC market share comparison with competitors.
  Identified top 5 customers and products contributing to overall revenue.
# Learnings & Takeaways
  This end-to-end project involved working with a substantial dataset of 1.8 million rows of data, including both dimension and fact tables. It provided invaluable hands-on   experience and reinforced skills in
•  Connecting to and extracting data from MySQL databases.
• Importing additional data from Excel and performing comprehensive transformations using Power Query.
•Establishing and optimizing relationships through effective data modeling.
•Calculating complex business KPIs using DAX.
•Utilizing advanced Power BI features such as bookmarks and parameters for enhanced user experience.
•Successfully deploying and managing dashboards on Power BI Service.

** This project significantly enhanced my ability to translate raw data into compelling data stories and actionable visualizations, empowering stakeholders with the insights needed for strategic decision-making.
